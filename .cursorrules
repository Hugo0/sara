This is a blog for Sara Perestrelo. It uses Hugo and Giscus for comments section.
Blog is deployed on Render.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
1. Bilingual Support:
   - Blog posts can be in English and Portuguese
   - Use index.en.md and index.pt.md in the same folder for bilingual posts
   - Single language posts use just index.md
   - Language switcher is implemented in the theme

2. Comments System:
   - Uses Giscus with "specific" mapping
   - Each post needs a unique giscus_term in frontmatter
   - Bilingual versions of the same post share the same giscus_term to keep comments synced
   - Format: "post-name-YYYYMMDD"

3. Theme Customizations:
   - Using Typo theme
   - Custom language switcher implementation
   - Custom post spacing and styling
   - Disable fast rebuilds when changing templates to ensure proper updates

4. Content Structure:
   - Main site UI is in English
   - Only blog posts can be bilingual
   - Posts are in content/posts/ directory
   - Each bilingual post has its own directory with language-specific files
