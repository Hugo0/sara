Very few diplomatic proposals in recent history have been as controversial as President Donald Trump's idea that the United States should purchase Greenland from Denmark. Perhaps only Brexit or the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement sparked similar levels of debate. The idea was quickly dismissed by Danish officials and widely criticized. While some know that the U.S. was built through territorial expansion, fewer people realize that Greenland has repeatedly been a target. What makes this remote Arctic island so desirable, and why has it been on Washington's wishlist?

## Historical Precedents: U.S. Territorial Expansion

For thousands of years, North America was populated by Native Americans and remained largely unknown to Europeans. It wasn't until the 1500s that the Europeans arrived and found a land of many natural resources. The French headed north, the Spanish settled south and west, and the British colonies developed along the east coast. The United States would first form as 13 separate colonies under the rule of the British Crown. However, the patriots were tired of having to follow rules and having to pay taxes to a government where they did not have representation. Eventually, these issues culminated in the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783).

After the British defeat, a peace treaty was signed. The colonies took their first steps toward a new system of government by drawing up what would become the Articles of Confederation, adopted by the Continental Congress in 1777 and fully ratified by 1781. This was the first constitution of the United States.

We should note that the U.S. political system was at first organized as a confederation. These are formed when independent states come together voluntarily to achieve some common objectives. In the past, confederations have usually been the predecessors of federal unions. For example, the modern Swiss Confederation, only in its name, was preceded by an association of cantons.

The reason why confederations usually do not survive and, in fact, there are none today, is that they often tend to evolve into a weak central government. Most power remains with the individual states, thereby depriving the central authority from functioning properly. Take, for example, the U.S. under the Articles of Confederation. In this case, the Congress could pass laws but they needed a two-thirds majority vote, which made it too difficult to pass any legislation. Without direct power over state finances, the government could not collect taxes, resulting in it not having any money to operate or to pay the huge debts it owed to Europe. More importantly, it had no national military and could not defend itself.[^1]

## More Historical Precedents: Negotiations on Greenland

Buying Greenland (and also Iceland) was first thought of during President Andrew Johnson's administration in 1867, the same year Alaska was bought. Diplomatic correspondence from that time indicates that the Secretary of State William Seward explored the possibility of acquiring Greenland and Iceland, similarly to Alaska. Some sources suggest that negotiations for purchasing both territories for 5.5 million dollars[^3] were nearly complete, but no formal offer was made, likely due to political challenges in the U.S. Congress at the time.

The idea resurfaced in 1910 under President William Taft, who proposed a land swap with Denmark. The U.S. would swap Mindanao in the Philippines for Greenland and the Danish West Indies. As we saw, the second deal ended up happening seven years later, but the first one did not go forward.

During World War II, when Germany occupied Denmark, a threat emerged that the Nazi forces could invade Greenland. The U.S. then, with authorization from Denmark, occupied the island temporarily in 1941 and created military bases to frustrate such eventualities by Germany. After the end of the war, preoccupied by the growth of the Soviet Union, President Harry Truman officially offered 100 million dollars[^4] to Denmark for Greenland. The Kingdom of Denmark refused, but later allowed the U.S to establish military bases on Greenland, such as the Thule Air Base, which is still operating today.

## Why is the U.S. Interested in Greenland now?

Greenland is attractive to the U.S. for both its strategic location and natural resources. As Arctic ice melts because of climate change, the trade routes around the area are becoming more navigable. Eventually, different routes will open up, allowing for ships to more efficiently take Northern routes instead of the traditional Southern ones, since a lot of these Arctic trade routes can be shorter.

Mining in Greenland is on the rise as global demand increases for rare earth elements, 17 metals crucial to technologies such as consumer electronics, renewable energy systems, and military equipment. Greenland has rich unexploited REE resources, and its ice is melting to reveal these resources due to climate change. China dominates 60% of the total supply of REEs globally and controls 90% of refining, something that has stimulated countries such as the U.S. to seek other sources in Greenland.

## The Principle of Self-Determination

One of the obstacles to any U.S. attempt to purchase Greenland in the modern era is the principle of self-determination. Both the UN Charter (Article 1(2))[^6] and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Article 1(3))[^7] declare that the inhabitants of Greenland have a right to self-determination regarding their political status. Before World War II, this principle was not broadly recognized or respected. Local populations were not able to consent over these trade agreements, since they had little power.

Following the referendum in 2008, only foreign and defense policy remained under Danish jurisdiction. In June 2009, the Act on Greenland Self-Government[^8] came into force, further confirming Greenland's autonomy. Additionally, two members of the Danish Parliament are now elected in Greenland. Therefore, no decision on Greenland's political future can be made unilaterally by Denmark. In fact, a recent poll revealed that 85% of Greenlanders oppose becoming part of the United States[^9].

## Conclusion

The U.S. has always had a territorial expansion policy based on strategic and economic interests, and Greenland remains a target due to its military advantages and rich natural resources. However, there are several complications in the modern world that were not an issue in earlier purchases, such as Alaska or the U.S. Virgin Islands. The principle of self-determination, recognized by international law, serves as a huge stumbling block toward the outright purchase of the country.

Rather than colonial-style acquisitions, the U.S. should seek to build a partnership with Europe based on mutual economic and security interests. By this approach, the U.S. will be able to reach its strategic goals within the Arctic whilst avoiding a conflict with a long term ally. In the end, Greenland could become for American expansionists a dream never to come true.
