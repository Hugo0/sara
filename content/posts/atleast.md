Many of you may not know that I come from Portugal, a small country in Southern Europe that’s often mistaken for being part of Spain or for being a location where *Harry Potter* could have been filmed. While its geography might be easy to overlook, its political *status quo* has been anything but fun-sized. In fact, Portugal has held three legislative elections since 2019, with a fourth one coming up this year. That means not a single government has lasted its full term, collapsing due to internal disputes, scandals and political deadlock. The latest crisis involved Prime Minister Luís Montenegro, in office since April 2024, who lost  a vote of confidence on March 11th.

What does all this have to do with the European elections? Well, I’m relieved they aren’t happening this year. With so many national elections back-to-back, voter fatigue is already a major concern. If the European elections were thrown into the mix, they would likely be even more overlooked than usual. And that’s a huge problem. While EU elections consistently see lower turnout than national ones, they are just as important, if not more. Many of the policies that shape our daily lives are decided at the European level.

**The controversy over the new land law**

Montenegro’s withdrawal from government started with the approval of a new Land Law aimed at reforming real estate and urban planning. At first, it seemed like a standard legislative move, but things took a turn when it was revealed that Spinumviva, a law consultancy linked to his name, had active contracts with private firms, such as the casino giant Solverde. The opposition and media quickly started investigating and stated that the law would benefit Spinumviva’s clients. The backlash was relentless, and despite attempts to defend himself, Montenegro found himself losing ground fast.

Before his downfall, two key parliamentary votes played a crucial role. First, there was a motion of censure, which is a vote proposed by a parliament group to the whole assembly, a formal way of saying "We don’t want this government anymore." If approved by an absolute majority of the MPs, the government is forced to resign. The first one was brought forward by Chega, a far-right party, but it was overwhelmingly rejected, with only the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP) abstaining. Then, the PCP itself proposed a second motion, which gained support from the left, while Chega and the Socialist Party (PS), the main opposition, abstained. This raised eyebrows. If the opposition really wanted Montenegro gone, why not unite behind the first motion? Politics, of course. Instead of taking immediate action, PS played the long game. 

PS wanted to propose a parliamentary inquiry instead. Under Portuguese law, refusing to testify or withholding documents could be a criminal offense. Then, in what seemed like an attempt to outmaneuver this possibility, his government called for a vote of confidence the very next day. Now, a vote of confidence is the government’s way of saying, “Do you still support us?” If Parliament says no, the government is forced to step down. Montenegro likely hoped this move would get him out of the inquiry, which it did. The controversy surrounding him had already eroded his support. When the vote finally happened, he lost. And with that, his government collapsed.

**Three election in the span of one year**

Portugal is gearing up for a historic electoral year. Madeira already went voting this past weekend after its regional government collapsed in December. In a twist that perfectly sums up Portuguese politics, Madeirans reelected the same candidate. In May, parliamentary elections will take place to approve a new government. Later in the year, local elections will be held, with voters electing representatives for 308 municipalities and over 3,000 parishes. And as if that was not enough, preparations are already in motion for the 2026 presidential election.

With so many elections in such a short time, one major concern looms: voter turnout. Portugal has struggled with high abstention rates for decades, and electoral fatigue may push even more people away from the ballot box. In the last parliamentary election, there was some optimism when abstention dropped to 33.8%, the lowest rate since 1995\. A win is a win. But that number still highlights how big voter disengagement is. The real challenge now is keeping people engaged. For many, political instability has made voting feel redundant. If governments keep falling, does their vote even matter? 

**How easy is it for a government to fall?**

It is important to acknowledge why there are repeated collapses in Portugal. Besides the reasons *in concreto* mentioned in the introduction, I believe our political system is also a source of instability. I know many people are not familiarised with this term, so I will keep it simple. A political system is the way a country organizes its government and how governors are appointed. 

In a presidential system, like the U.S., the president is directly elected by the people, has strong executive power and cannot be easily removed except through impeachment. In a parliamentary system, like the U.K., the prime minister is chosen by parliament, governs with its support, and can be removed through a vote of no confidence. A semi-presidential system, like France or Portugal, is a mix of both. There’s a president elected by the people who shares power with a prime minister backed by parliament. The key differences lie in who makes decisions, how leaders are chosen, and what happens if a government loses support.

Portugal operates under a semi-presidential system, where executive power is divided between the president and the prime minister. The president, elected independently from the parliament, can dissolve the parliament or call elections. However, the prime minister runs the day-to-day administration and must maintain the support of parliament. If the prime minister resigns or is forced out, the entire government falls, triggering new elections.

This instability is a stark contrast to Canada’s purely parliamentary system. When a Canadian prime minister steps down, the ruling party can simply elect a new leader. It was what happened earlier this year when Justin Trudeau announced his resignation. Despite growing pressure from his party due to declining popularity, the Liberal Party was able to replace him without triggering a national election.

France’s political system is often seen as more stable than Portugal’s, and a big reason for that is how much power the president holds. Both countries follow a semi-presidential model, but France leans more toward a presidential system, while Portugal is closer to a parliamentary structure. In France, the president isn’t just a figurehead. They appoint the prime minister, shape policy, and play an active role in governance. This means that even if parliament shifts politically, the government doesn’t immediately fall apart.

**Voter turnout in European elections**

One small relief is that the European elections aren’t happening this year. If they were, voter fatigue would likely be even worse than it already is. Historically, Portugal has one of the lowest turnouts in EU elections, with just 36.5% of eligible voters participating in 2024[^1]. This is concerning because voter abstention is high in many Member States, making it clear that European elections do not have the attention they deserve. This happens because people have the perception that European politics are distant and disconnected from everyday life.

Yet, European elections are crucial because an increasing number of laws that govern Member States are now being made at the EU level. These laws are common, created to ensure consistency across all states. This ensures that businesses in different countries operate under the same rules and citizens enjoy similar rights and freedoms. The process of passing laws in the EU involves several key institutions: the European Commission, the Council and the European Parliament, the only one directly elected by the citizens. In simple terms (not even correctly), the Commission proposes new laws, the Parliament reviews and amends those proposals, while the Council represents the national governments and votes on the laws. Once an agreement is reached, the law is passed and becomes binding for all Member States.

However, not all EU laws are the same. Some come in the form of regulations, which are directly binding on all Member States and override national laws. These types of laws are typically used when uniformity is required across the EU. For example, the EU regulation on food labeling ensures that all food products across Member States display consistent information about ingredients, allergens, and nutritional values. Other laws are passed as directives, which set out goals but leave Member States with the freedom to decide how to implement them. For instance, the Data Protection Directive in 1995 led to varying privacy laws across countries, but these were later harmonized through the General Data Protection Regulation in 2018 (GDPR). Finally, decisions are another form of EU legislation. They are binding only on the specific Member States, individuals or companies and are often used in matters such as competition law.

Given the significant impact of EU legislation, low voter turnout is particularly concerning. Many voters in European elections choose to vote based on national party lines, failing to consider how these parties align with European political groups. This disconnect can lead to unexpected results, with domestic parties sometimes joining coalitions in the European Parliament that do not reflect the views of their domestic supporters. If voter turnout does not improve, the gap between citizens and European governance will only continue to widen, leaving important decisions about policies that affect millions in the hands of a few. This makes it even more important for citizens to engage in European elections and recognize the power these elections hold in shaping the future of the Union.

**Conclusion**

The political instability of Portugal, marked by constant governments tumbling and the pressures of multiple elections within a brief period of time, emphasizes the growing issues of voter turnout. As political fatigue starts to set in, it is crucial for the voters to realize the importance of their vote, both nationally as well as in the European elections. European elections, although traditionally overlooked, are more significant than ever as they decide legislation that affects all Member States. Since legislation is increasingly being made at EU level, the voters must turn out in large numbers to make European politics a true representation of the people's will. If this trend of low turnout continues, it could lead to citizens feeling disconnected from policies that touch their lives and thus reinforcing the vulnerability of democracy. Portugal and the EU's future lies in citizens being informed and engaged in the political process regardless of how intimidating it may seem.
